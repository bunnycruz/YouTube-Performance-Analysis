# YouTube-Performance-Analysis
Analysis of YouTube channel performance to predict revenue and optimize content.
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`YouTube-Performance-Analysis.ipynb`) analyzing YouTube channel performance data to predict `Estimated Revenue (USD)` and provide content optimization recommendations. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, visualization, and predictive modeling using a Random Forest Regressor.

## Key Findings
- Views are the primary driver of revenue.
- Videos of 5-10 minutes with high thumbnail CTR perform best.
- Recommendations: Optimize thumbnails, encourage engagement, target high-CPM niches.

## Requirements
- Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `isodate`, `joblib`.
